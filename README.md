## Description
For our summer internship with the NFL, our Seedkit Team 7 took on the challenge of creating a personalized game experience allowing fans to interact with the game through existing fan needs. 

We created an all-encompassing fan dashboard with a customizable game watching experience and features such as sports betting, peer to peer betting, fantasy integration, chatting, and game statistics. We implemented our game watching experience using "The Queue" which gives fans the ability to dictate the players and teams they want to watch given their preferences. Our team also found key metrics for NFL X such as financial outlook, invesetment thesis, and marketing plan, as well as conducting user research to see what fans thought of our platform.

## How To Use

### Prerequistes
- Download Node.JS Installer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The installer comes with the NPM package manager. 

### Installing Git and Planning Your Enviornment
1. Start by forking the repo (top right of the page). This will create a copy of the main repository on your GitHub account. 
You can find this respository by navigating to your own GitHub page. This forked repo will be your main repo for you to develop on this project. 
To merge your updates into the main branch, simply create a pull request via your forked repo. This will allow the project managers to review your submitted code before it merges into the main project repository.
2. Install the desktop git client if you do not have it already ([Git Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or `sudo apt install git` on Ubuntu). You can see if your git is working properly by simply typing `git` in your terminal (Git bash/MinGW on Windows)
3. Choose the folder/directory where you would like to work in (where your local repo will be stored). You can do this by typing `cd YOUR_PREFERRED_DIRECTORY` in your terminal
4. Now that you are in your preferred working directory, clone your forked repo by running `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/nfl-x` in your terminal.

### Running the Code 
- Run NPM to install all necessary packages/dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

- Compile and run the code
```sh
npm run
```
